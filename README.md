## **Abstract**
We present HunyuanVideo, a novel open-source video foundation model that exhibits performance in video generation that is comparable to, if not superior to, leading closed-source models. In order to train HunyuanVideo model, we adopt several key technologies for model learning, including data curation, image-video joint model training, and an efficient infrastructure designed to facilitate large-scale model training and inference. Additionally, through an effective strategy for scaling model architecture and dataset, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. 

We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion diversity, text-video alignment, and generation stability. According to professional human evaluation results, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and 3 top performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code and weights of the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source video foundation models. This initiative will empower everyone in the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem. 

## **HunyuanVideo Overall Architecture**

HunyuanVideo is trained on a spatial-temporally
compressed latent space, which is compressed through Causal 3D VAE. Text prompts are encoded
using a large language model, and used as the condition. Gaussian noise and condition are taken as
input, our generate model generates an output latent, which is decoded to images or videos through
the 3D VAE decoder.

## 🎉 **HunyuanVideo Key Features**
### **Unified Image and Video Generative Architecture**
HunyuanVideo introduces the Transformer design and employs a Full Attention mechanism for unified image and video generation. 
Specifically, we use a "Dual-stream to Single-stream" hybrid model design for video generation. In the dual-stream phase, video and text
tokens are processed independently through multiple Transformer blocks, enabling each modality to learn its own appropriate modulation mechanisms without interference. In the single-stream phase, we concatenate the video and text
tokens and feed them into subsequent Transformer blocks for effective multimodal information fusion.
This design captures complex interactions between visual and semantic information, enhancing
overall model performance.

</p>

### **MLLM Text Encoder**
Some previous text-to-video models typically use pretrained CLIP and T5-XXL as text encoders where CLIP uses Transformer Encoder and T5 uses a Encoder-Decoder structure. In constrast, we utilize a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with a Decoder-Only structure as our text encoder, which has following advantages: (i) Compared with T5, MLLM after visual instruction finetuning has better image-text alignment in the feature space, which alleviates the difficulty of instruction following in diffusion models; (ii)
Compared with CLIP, MLLM has been demonstrated superior ability in image detail description
and complex reasoning; (iii) MLLM can play as a zero-shot learner by following system instructions prepended to user prompts, helping text features pay more attention to key information. In addition, MLLM is based on causal attention while T5-XXL utilizes bidirectional attention that produces better text guidance for diffusion models. Therefore, we introduce an extra bidirectional token refiner for enhancing text features.

</p>

### **3D VAE**
HunyuanVideo trains a 3D VAE with CausalConv3D to compress pixel-space videos and images into a compact latent space. We set the compression ratios of video length, space and channel to 4, 8 and 16 respectively. This can significantly reduce the number of tokens for the subsequent diffusion transformer model, allowing us to train videos at the original resolution and frame rate.

</p>

### **Prompt Rewrite**
To address the variability in linguistic style and length of user-provided prompts, we fine-tune the [Hunyuan-Large model](https://github.com/Tencent/Tencent-Hunyuan-Large) as our prompt rewrite model to adapt the original user prompt to model-preferred prompt.

We provide two rewrite modes: Normal mode and Master mode, which can be called using different prompts. The prompts are shown [here](hyvideo/prompt_rewrite.py). The Normal mode is designed to enhance the video generation model's comprehension of user intent, facilitating a more accurate interpretation of the instructions provided. The Master mode enhances the description of aspects such as composition, lighting, and camera movement, which leans towards generating videos with a higher visual quality. However, this emphasis may occasionally result in the loss of some semantic details. 

The Prompt Rewrite Model can be directly deployed and inferred using the [Hunyuan-Large original code](https://github.com/Tencent/Tencent-Hunyuan-Large). We release the weights of the Prompt Rewrite Model [here](https://huggingface.co/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-PromptRewrite).

## 📈 Comparisons

To evaluate the performance of HunyuanVideo, we selected five strong baselines from closed-source video generation models. In total, we utilized 1,533 text prompts, generating an equal number of video samples with HunyuanVideo in a single run. For a fair comparison, we conducted inference only once, avoiding any cherry-picking of results. When comparing with the baseline methods, we maintained the default settings for all selected models, ensuring consistent video resolution. Videos were assessed based on three criteria: Text Alignment, Motion Quality, and Visual Quality. More than 60 professional evaluators performed the evaluation. Notably, HunyuanVideo demonstrated the best overall performance, particularly excelling in motion quality. Please note that the evaluation is based on Hunyuan Video's high-quality version. This is different from the currently released fast version.
